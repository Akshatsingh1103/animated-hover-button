This project creates glowing neon buttons with cool animations using HTML and CSS. The buttons have hover effects that make them light up with a blue glow, giving a futuristic look. Each button has moving animated borders that continuously flow around it, adding a dynamic feel. The background is black to make the neon colors pop, and the buttons are linked to a website. Itâ€™s a simple yet visually appealing design for interactive web elements.
